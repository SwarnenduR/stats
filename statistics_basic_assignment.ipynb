    " - An example of an interval variable would be temperature. We can correctly assume that the difference between 70 and 80 degrees is the same as the difference between 80 and 90 degrees. However, the mathematical operations of multiplication and division do not apply to interval variables. For instance, we cannot accurately say that 100 degrees is twice as hot as 50 degrees. Additionally, interval variables often do not have a meaningful zero-point. For example, a temperature of zero degrees (on Celsius and Fahrenheit scales) does not mean a complete absence of heat."

    "### What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "#### The most common measure of central tendencies are - Mean, Median and Mode\n",
    "#### Mean: The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It can be calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the number of values. In general, it is considered as the arithmetic mean. It is observed that if all the values in the dataset are the same, then all geometric, arithmetic and harmonic mean values are the same. If there is variability in the data, then the mean value differs. Some other measures of mean used to find the central tendency are as follows:\n",
    "- Geometric Mean\n",
    "- Harmonic Mean\n",
    "- Weighted Mean\n",
    "#### Median: Median is the middle value of the dataset in which the dataset is arranged in the ascending order or in descending order. When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the median value of the dataset can be found by taking the mean of the middle two values.\n",
    "- Consider the given dataset with the odd number of observations arranged in descending order – 23, 21, 18, 16, 15, 13, 12, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, and 2\n",
    "    -Here 12 is the middle or median number that has 6 values above it and 6 values below it.\n",
    "- Now, consider another example with an even number of observations that are arranged in descending order – 40, 38, 35, 33, 32, 30, 29, 27, 26, 24, 23, 22, 19, and 17\n",
    "    -When you look at the given dataset, the two middle values obtained are 27 and 29. Now, find out the mean value for these two numbers. i.e.,(27+29)/2 =28. Therefore, the median for the given data distribution is 28.\n",
    "#### Mode: The mode represents the frequently occurring value in the dataset. Sometimes the dataset may contain multiple modes and in some cases, it does not contain any mode at all.\n",
    "- Consider the given dataset 5, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 5\n",
    "    -Since the mode represents the most common value. Hence, the most frequently repeated value in the given dataset is 5.\n",
    "#### Based on the properties of the data, the measures of central tendency are selected.\n",
    "- If we have a symmetrical distribution of continuous data, all the three measures of central tendency hold good. But most of the times, the analyst uses the mean because it involves all the values in the distribution or dataset.\n",
    "- If we have skewed distribution, the best measure of finding the central tendency is the median.\n",
    "- If we have the original data, then both the median and mode are the best choice of measuring the central tendency.\n",
    "- If we have categorical data, the mode is the best choice to find the central tendency."
