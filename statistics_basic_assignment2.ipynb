    "#### The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set. The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest. The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.\n",
    "#### Mean: The mean represents the average value of the dataset. It can be calculated as the sum of all the values in the dataset divided by the number of values. In general, it is considered as the arithmetic mean. It is observed that if all the values in the dataset are the same, then all geometric, arithmetic and harmonic mean values are the same. If there is variability in the data, then the mean value differs. Some other measures of mean used to find the central tendency are as follows:\n",
    "- Geometric Mean\n",
    "- Harmonic Mean\n",
    "- Weighted Mean\n",
    "#### Median: Median is the middle value of the dataset in which the dataset is arranged in the ascending order or in descending order. When the dataset contains an even number of values, then the median value of the dataset can be found by taking the mean of the middle two values.\n",

    "    -Here 12 is the middle or median number that has 6 values above it and 6 values below it.\n",

    "    -When you look at the given dataset, the two middle values obtained are 27 and 29. Now, find out the mean value for these two numbers. i.e.,(27+29)/2 =28. Therefore, the median for the given data distribution is 28.\n",
    "#### Mode: The mode represents the frequently occurring value in the dataset. Sometimes the dataset may contain multiple modes and in some cases, it does not contain any mode at all.\n",
    "- Consider the given dataset 5, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 5\n",
    "    -Since the mode represents the most common value. Hence, the most frequently repeated value in the given dataset is 5."

    "#### Variance: Variance measures how far each number in the dataset from the mean. To compute variance first, calculate the mean and squared deviations from a mean. Observation near to mean value gets the lower result and far from means gets higher value. There would be two variance calculation - Population variance and Sample variance.\n",

    "#### Skewness is a measurement of the distortion of symmetrical distribution or asymmetry in a data set. Skewness is demonstrated on a bell curve when data points are not distributed symmetrically to the left and right sides of the median on a bell curve. If the bell curve is shifted to the left or the right, it is said to be skewed. Skewness can be quantified as a representation of the extent to which a given distribution varies from a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a zero skew, while a lognormal distribution, for example, would exhibit some right skew.\n",
    "#### A positively skewed distribution is the right-skewed distribution with the long tail on its right side. The value of skewness for a positively skewed distribution is greater than zero. The value of the mean is the greatest one, followed by the median and then by mode.\n",
    "#### A negatively skewed distribution is the left-skewed distribution with the long tail on its left side. The value of skewness for a negatively skewed distribution is less than zero. The measure of central tendencies is mean < median < mode."

    "- Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable. A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in the same direction. Therefore, when one variable increases as the other variable increases or one variable decreases while the other decreases. An example of a positive correlation would be height and weight. A negetive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which two variables move in the different direction. Therefore, when one variable increases as the other variable decreases or one variable decreases while the other increases. An example of a negetive correlation would be a student who has many absences has a decrease in grades.\n",
    "- Covariance tells us the direction of the relationship between two variables, while correlation provides an indication as to how strong the relationship between the two variables is, in addition to the direction of correlated variables. Correlation values range from +1 to -1. Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables while correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Correlation is a function of the covariance. For an example, covariance is used in portfolio theory to determine what assets to include in the portfolio."

Mean is the only measure of central tendency that is always affected by an outlier. Mean, the average, is the most popular measure of central tendency. When a outlier is present it can effect the shape of the graph, if we have outliers to the right of the graph. These outliers are causing the mean to increase, but if we have outliers to the left of the graph these outliers are dragging down the mean. This causes a conflict because the mean no longer provides a good representation of the data, alternatively we would much rather use the median. The median on the other hand is less likely to be affect by outliers.\n",
